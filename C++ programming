                    NUMBER GUESSING GAME
Create a program that generates a random number and asks theuser to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is toohigh or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

int main() {
    // Initialize random seed
    std::srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(std::time(0)));

    // Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    int randomNumber = std::rand() % 100 + 1;
    int userGuess = 0;
    int attempts = 0;

    std::cout << "Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "I have selected a random number between 1 and 100." << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Try to guess it!" << std::endl;

    // Loop until the user guesses the correct number
    while (userGuess != randomNumber) {
        std::cout << "Enter your guess: ";
        std::cin >> userGuess;
        attempts++;

        if (userGuess > randomNumber) {
            std::cout << "Too high! Try again." << std::endl;
        } else if (userGuess < randomNumber) {
            std::cout << "Too low! Try again." << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number " << randomNumber << " in " << attempts << " attempts!" << std::endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
